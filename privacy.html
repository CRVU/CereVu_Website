                <h2>Opt In or Opt Out</h2>
                <p>You are always in control of your data, and if you choose to receive information from us or others, you can change your mind later. If, at any time, you would like to stop receiving such information or opt out of a feature, you may notify us by writing to <a href="mailto:info@cerevu.com">info@cerevu.com</a>. You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our databases and servers, although we will always make reasonable efforts to do so upon your request. Keep in mind that we may be unable to have your information removed from the records of any third party, who has been provided with your information in accordance with this policy.</p>

                <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
                <p>This Website may provide links to other websites. Please be aware that these other websites are not covered under our Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices exercised by other providers of products or services, advertisers or other websites, companies or individuals, which are not owned or controlled by CereVu. We suggest that when linking to another website, you always read that website's privacy policy before volunteering any personally identifiable information.</p>

                <h2>Data Retention</h2>
                <p>Generally, CereVu does not retain information longer than necessary to provide its services and for its reasonable business and lawful needs. If you withdraw your consent to us processing your data, we will erase your personal data from our systems (unless the data is required for CereVu to establish, exercise or defend against legal claims or it is necessary for the performance of the requested services), and inform other relevant parties to which we have disclosed your personal data of the erasure request.</p>

                <h2>HIPAA Compliance</h2>
                <p>When applicable, CereVu complies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for protected health information. If you are receiving healthcare services in the United States, certain health information collected through our Services may be protected under HIPAA. In such cases, your healthcare provider is responsible for HIPAA compliance, and we may act as a Business Associate to your healthcare provider.</p>

                <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
                <p>CalOPPA requires commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers, to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.</p>

                <h4>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once this Privacy Policy is created, we will add a link to it on the first significant page after entering our Website.</li>
                    <li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the Website.</li>
                    <li>You can request to change your Personal Information by emailing us.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>CAN-SPAM Act</h2>
                <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a Federal US law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

                <h4>To be in accordance with CAN-SPAM, we agree to the following:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not to use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
                    <li>Identify the commercial message sent to you as an advertisement when required.</li>
                    <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>
                    <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if used.</li>
                    <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>
                    <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at <a href="mailto:info@cerevu.com">info@cerevu.com</a>.</p>
